# AI-and-ML-Models-From-Training-to-Deployment
This Repository for my blog "Demystifying AI and ML Models: From Training to Deployment" along with additional resources, code examples, and project ideas related to AI, ML, and model deployment.


**Some Project Ideas:**

1. **Sentiment Analysis Web App:**
   Develop a web application that uses NLP techniques to analyze and visualize sentiment from user-provided text. Users can input text, and the app will determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

2. **Image Classification Using Transfer Learning:**
   Build an image classification model using transfer learning with a pre-trained deep learning model like VGG or ResNet. Create a Python script that allows users to upload an image and get predictions for the objects present in the image.

3. **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:**
   Create a real-time anomaly detection system that uses time series models to detect anomalies in sensor data. This can be applied to various domains such as industrial machinery monitoring or network traffic analysis.

4. **Chatbot for Customer Support:**
   Design a chatbot that uses NLP to provide customer support on a website or messaging platform. The chatbot should be capable of understanding user queries and providing relevant responses.

5. **Predictive Maintenance for Equipment:**
   Develop a predictive maintenance model that uses historical equipment data to predict when maintenance is needed. This can help optimize maintenance schedules and reduce downtime.
